Hi, my name is Ted McCormick, and I'm a software developer.

I'd like to take a trip back a little bit. I saw my first Codeup billboard in 2015. I remember because it stuck with me. I was a successful stockbroker - I had the best numbers of anyone at the company I was with, and I was miserable.

It was sales, and it was in a call-center, and I was hustling to work on an MBA part time, and every day I got home from work and I was exhausted, and the days blended together. It felt like every day, I was having the same conversations, over and over and over again, and every month, all the numbers on our tracking board went back to zero.

And then my wife and I had our first kid.

So fast forward a couple of years. By 2019 I had two kids at home when I finally sent an email, trying to decide if I should do Codeup or not, whether I could do something so irresponsible, to change my whole course in life, to change my whole direction, to open up my horizons.

Ultimately I'm sitting here because I did. And in the last six months I've written, conservatively, about 23,000 lines of code. And I don't think the last six months are necessarily representative of the next six months, or six years, but one thing I've discovered is that there's *always* something new. Even if you don't have something unique and novel cross your desk during the day - go out tonight and learn a new framework! Learn a new language! Learn a new way of doing what you've already done. Build on what you've already done, connect the data in new ways...the possibilities are endless.

And ultimately that's what's exciting to me. Every day is new, and different, and even though I've written 23,000 lines of code, chances are that the next ten lines of code I write are going to be totally different, and new, and unique. And I'm grateful to Codeup for that opportunity, to every day wake up, and face a new challenge that I can solve with code.

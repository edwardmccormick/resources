    The grow effect on your profile image covers up your header text awkwardly, so I'd adjust either the spacing or the size of the animation.
    I'd recommend splitting your site into a few different pages, all part of your nav menu: Home, Resume, Projects, Contact
        Put the PDF view of your resume on your resume page, not in the nav bar
    Move your contact information into a footer and/or separate contact page
    Remove the line of "Everything here can be found" from your footer - that should be main body text
    Delete the icons from the footer, and remove the line about the trademark
    Remove "A full stack developer" from your nav
    I would add a short bio that is more robust than the breakfast and tacos line for before the Annapolis, Leader, Developer section
    The image on your resume page should be right below the nav bar - remove the section that currently has your contact and "How did I get here"
    The vertical column organization of your resume is hard to follow. I would have the projects, professional experience, and other pieces be 100% width as their own sections organized in a vertical scroll
    Again, pull the full description of your project work into a separate projects page
    In terms of styling:
        See if you can mix up from straight black and white to pretty it up
        Work on spacing out your page sections more naturally, so we see a break between different sections. A simple <hr> as a starting point will show what I'm talking about.
        I don't love the font choice
        Introduce some variety in your levels of headers beyond just size: bold, italics, color - help the viewer differentiate each separate level more clearly
        Introduce some sort of colored or image background to make the footer stand out from the main body text

Things to do for my vanity site -

submit form should be internal to the webpage, not external through ElFormo - PHP here I come!
add email address, obsfucated
Resume that is ready for action - responsive and looks good in lots of different layouts
Skills page that actually ties together the skills I've learned - try to make it almost predictive off a job interview.

Already done -

BS Navbar and responsive
Portfolio page to show off all the work I am not done with yet
contact me page works and is clean and functional
Skills page - basically just a chance to talk myself up? Should probably be more

mistakes I made:

misplaced <div> not showing content on the tab

copy and paste led to MULTIPLE 'active' tabs (I also did it on some of the form elements but it wasn't nearly as devestating from a design perspective)

misunderstanding tabs - started off with an unordered list, switched to a div later for clarity

datatoggle! was a genuine aha <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> moment

things that made me most proud:
getting all the buttons to cycle correctly
putting the first tab (size and crust) to width 100 because at width 75 it looked lousy on smaller screens
the nav bar and jumbotron look *almost* exactly like the example, and work the way they're supposed to


misses:
I sort of wanted to put all of the forms together and actually practice 'submitting' everything - alas I wasn't really focused on it while building it and it felt like it was going to be kind of a long pull to 'normalize' it all
I couldn't get the password show/hide button to work and had to scrap it
I also wanted to do a 'better' validation on the form and basically ran out of time while simultaneously reaching my technical limits
didn't comment basically anything (SHAME SHAME SHAME)

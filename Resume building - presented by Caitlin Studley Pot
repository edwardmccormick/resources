Resume - a listing of qualifications and experience

Automated Tracking Systems - systems companies use in order to track applicants. Sometimes LOTS of applicants.

	You may also be applying to the same job posting listed in multiple places/across multiple postings
	We don't necessarily know what filters/keywords exist behind the screen - but we can try to 'troubleshoot' by reading requirements

Don't lie on your resume. It might slink through but is instantly disqualifying. Anything on your resume is fair game.

X amount of years of experience - sometimes there's just no workaround. Placement team will help guide you.

Formatting matter - word doc vs pdf - can be an attention to detail issue.

Applications can be a pain in the butt - it's not personal.

Phrasing your accomplishments professionally but powerfully.

Selective about what you include.
Quantify your accomplishment and use data.
Transferable skills: customer service, collaboration, time management, organization, project management
(not just "responsible for")
Focus on keywords -- look at job descriptions and tie them back to your resume.

Do NOT - put a photo on your resume
No Address
No generic "About Me" - 
No overly designed resumes
No soft skills - focus on tech
Do not link to a personal portfolio page unless it's approved by PD team - oops

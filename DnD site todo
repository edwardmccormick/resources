Three main choices to start:
1) A have a character to input
Character to input - should:
-Allow you to input character stats (done!)
-Allow you to see modifiers from character attributes
-Allow you to select character proficiencies in line with character class(es)
    -Eventually allow for multi-class characters
    -eventually allow for background selection as well
-Allow you to either input HP or take average HP
-allow you to see SRD weapons/armor that your character qualifies for

2) I need to generate a character (point buy)

-Should guide you through the point buy process
-Tell you how many points you have left/how many you have used (done!)
-tell you what the focuses for your class should be
-allow you to select race and apply those modifiers
-hook in to allow you to select proficiencies/background/equipment

3) I need to generate a character (roll for stats)

-Should guide you through the rolling process/explain the different methods
-Give you a ranking on how rare your character is
-Give you an array that you can rearrange within the different attributes (done!)
-show you the attribute bonuses/skill from applying those attributes
-allow you to select race and apply those modifiers
-hook in to allow you to select proficiencies/background/equipment

Why are the tabs no longer working? And should I revert to the version that *was* working? Extra div discovered and destroyed - booyah!

I should totally do it all in Tailwind just as an exercise. Eff yeah! (except tailwind literally killed my computer :-/)
